### Enhancements

#### SLLogCollector packages will now include nslookup output for hostnames [ID 39526]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU9] - FR 10.4.7 -->

From now on, SLLogCollector packages will also include the *nslookup* output for the hostname configured in

- *MaintenanceSettings.xml* (HTTPS) and/or
- *DMS.xml* (Failover).

#### OpenSearch: Enhanced performance of alarm queries [ID 40674]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU9] - FR 10.4.12 -->

Alarm filters containing brackets can now be translated to OpenSearch queries. This will considerably improve overall performance of alarm queries against OpenSearch databases.

#### Security enhancements [ID 40684]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU21]/10.4.0 [CU9] - FR 10.4.12 -->

A number of security enhancements have been made.

#### SLLogCollector: Miscellaneous enhancements [ID 40935]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU9] - FR 10.4.12 -->

A number of enhancements have been made to the SLLogCollector tool:

- SLLogCollector packages will now include:

  - SSL certificates
  - Cube version information
  - Web API version information

- Hostnames will now be resolved via `System.Net.Dns.GetHostAddresses` instead of *nslookup*.

#### SLXML: Enhanced error when erroneous XML code is received [ID 40995]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU21]/10.4.0 [CU9] - FR 10.4.12 -->

Up to now, when SLXML received erroneous XML code, the error message logged in *SLXML.txt* would lose vital information when it was trimmed by SLLog due to the 5120-character error message size limit. The error message in question has now been adapted so that the most important information is found at the beginning.

#### SLLogCollector will no longer be configured by default to collect the log files of the DataAPI DxM [ID 41003]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU9] - FR 10.4.12 -->

Up to now, SLLogCollector would by default be configured to collect the log files of the DataAPI DxM. From now on, this will no longer be the case. Only when the DataAPI DxM is deployed, will SLLogCollector be configured to collect the log files of said DxM.

#### SLLogCollector will no longer be configured by default to collect the log files of the CommunicationGateway DxM [ID 41004]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU21]/10.4.0 [CU9] - FR 10.4.12 -->

Up to now, SLLogCollector would by default be configured to collect the log files of the CommunicationGateway DxM. From now on, this will no longer be the case. Only when the CommunicationGateway DxM is deployed, will SLLogCollector be configured to collect the log files of said DxM.

### Fixes

#### Problem when trying to access trend statistics on a DataMiner Cube connected via gRPC [ID 40668]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU21]/10.4.0 [CU9] - FR 10.4.12 -->

When DataMiner Cube was connected to a DataMiner Agent via gRPC, because of a deserialization issue on the server, it would not be possible to access trend statistics.

#### Problem when DataMiner Agent is named DATAMINER [ID 40743]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU9] - FR 10.4.12 -->

From DataMiner 10.4.0 [CU2]/10.4.5 onwards, when the computer name of a DataMiner server was DATAMINER, the server would no longer function correctly.

#### SLAnalytics - Behavioral anomaly detection: Updates to alarm templates used in alarm template groups could be disregarded [ID 40783]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU21]/10.4.0 [CU9] - FR 10.4.12 -->

Up to now, when an alarm template used in an alarm template group was updated, and no element was using that template directly, in some cases, SLAnalytics would disregard the update. This could then lead to an incorrect anomaly alarm configuration being applied to elements using the alarm template group and to incorrect focus values being set in the alarms of the elements using the alarm template group.

#### Service & Resource Management: Bookings could incorrectly be saved with a non-existing capacity parameter [ID 40808]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU9] - FR 10.4.12 -->

Up to now, a booking could incorrectly be saved with a non-existing capacity parameter of which the value was set to zero.

#### Problem with alarm severity of a service not being updated correctly [ID 40840]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU21]/10.4.0 [CU9] - FR 10.4.12 -->

In some cases, the alarm severity of a service would not be updated correctly when, during a row update, both the display key and the monitored value had been changed.

#### Failover: Problem with SLSNMPManager at startup [ID 40883]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU21]/10.4.0 [CU9] - FR 10.4.12 -->

When a DataMiner Agent that was part of a Failover setup started up, in some cases, SLSNMPManager could stop working.

#### Problem when a DVE or virtual function element was deleted while a subscription was updated [ID 40900]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU21]/10.4.0 [CU9] - FR 10.4.12 -->

When a DVE element or virtual function element was deleted while a subscription on the parent element or one of the child elements was updated, in some cases, especially when Stream Viewer was open, a run-time error could occur.

#### Incomplete CorrelationDetailsEvent messages after a DMA had reconnected to the DMS [ID 40934]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU21]/10.4.0 [CU9] - FR 10.4.12 -->

When a DataMiner Agent reconnected to the DataMiner System of which it was a member (e.g. after having been restarted), in some rare cases, *CorrelationDetailsEvent* messages could be incomplete.

#### SLAnalytics - Behavioral anomaly detection: Alarm template of DVE parent element would incorrectly be used when monitoring was disabled in the alarm template of the DVE child template [ID 40963]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU9] - FR 10.4.12 -->

When a DVE child element had an alarm template in which you had configured that a particular parameter should not be monitored while, in the alarm template of the DVE parent element, you had configured anomaly monitoring for that same parameter, up to now, the behavioral anomaly detection mechanism would incorrectly use the alarm template configuration of the DVE parent element. From now on, in these situations, it will use the alarm template configuration of the DVE child element instead.

#### MySQL database optimization task would incorrectly be run on systems with a database other than MySQL [ID 40985]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU9] - FR 10.4.12 -->

Up to now, a MySQL database optimization task would incorrectly also be run on systems with a database other than MySQL.
